# Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Employee Payroll Scheme

## Overview

This repository focuses on the analysis and scoring of employees for layoff assessment. The analysis considers factors such as total working hours, total working days, and employee salary per hour. Scoring is performed with a weight of 40% on total working hours, 40% on salary per hour, and 20% on total working days. The scoring uses quartiles for each assessment to obtain appropriate scores. The results identify employees with high scores and those with low scores. These scores serve as a reference for company's layoff scheme.

## Methodology

The analysis employs statistical methods, data visualization, and comparative studies to assess the cost-effectiveness of various employee payroll schemes. Clear visual representations of cost structures, comparisons, and trends provide valuable insights for decision-making.

## Data

- Employees
- Timesheets

## Analysis

SQL and Jupyter Notebooks scripts demonstrating the data processing, analysis, and visualization steps are provided in this section.

In the conducted analysis, key findings and insights regarding the cost-effectiveness of different employee payroll schemes are highlighted. The results aim to guide organizations in making informed decisions to optimize resources and achieve financial sustainability.
In the conducted analysis, several employees were evaluated based on their total working hours, salary per hour, and total working days. The scoring system, with a 40-40-20 weight distribution, identified employees with high and low scores. A score of 60 is considered the minimum for employees to remain employed at the company. The analysis resulted in 23 employees with scores below 60, making them candidates for layoff. This decision is based on the assumption that employees with lower scores may not contribute significantly to company's performance.
