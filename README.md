In the conducted analysis, key findings and insights regarding the cost-effectiveness of different employee payroll schemes are highlighted. The results aim to guide organizations in making informed decisions to optimize resources and achieve financial sustainability.
In the conducted analysis, several employees were evaluated based on their total working hours, salary per hour, and total working days. The scoring system, with a 40-40-20 weight distribution, identified employees with high and low scores. A score of 60 is considered the minimum for employees to remain employed at the company. The analysis resulted in 23 employees with scores below 60, making them candidates for layoff. This decision is based on the assumption that employees with lower scores may not contribute significantly to company's performance.
